I developed a secure web application called MI6 Secure Intelligence Portal using Python Flask as the backend framework. The purpose of this project was to create a functional and secure system that simulates an intelligence agencyâ€™s portal, focusing on authentication, data security, and backend logic implementation.

The application uses Flask routing to handle different endpoints such as Home, Login, Dashboard, and Logout. I implemented user authentication using hashed passwords and session management to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive pages. The portal displays mission details and agent codes after successful login, demonstrating dynamic content rendering with Jinja2 templates.

On the frontend, I designed the interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive design and a clean user experience. The backend is connected to an SQLite database to store user credentials securely and fetch mission data dynamically. I also followed modular coding practices by separating routes, templates, and static files for maintainability.

For security, I implemented measures like password hashing and restricted direct URL access without authentication. The project also supports session expiration on logout, preventing unauthorized re-entry. During development, I extensively tested all routes and functionalities to ensure a seamless experience.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Python Flask, template rendering, database integration, and web security principles. It helped me understand how to manage backend logic, handle form data, and maintain state using sessions in a real-world application.

Future enhancements for this project include adding two-factor authentication, implementing role-based access control, and integrating API support for mission updates.

Overall, this project strengthened my skills in Python programming, Flask development, and web application security, making it a strong demonstration of my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
